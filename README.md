#### Disclaimer: In experimental stage, unfortunately it doesn't have a stable version yet.

React Ape is a react renderer to build UI interfaces using canvas/WebGL. React Ape was built to be an optional [React-TV](https://github.com/raphamorim/react-tv) renderer. It's mainly a renderer focused on creating things for TV, PS5, PS4, Nintendo Switch, PS Vita, PS3 and low memory devices.

## Testing it

React-Ape's CI uses circleci/node:16.13.1 (linux) and since canvas renders a different output based on the operating system. It requires run the tests on the same OS. Please be aware if you want to contribute in a different OS, make sure to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.
